    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The traditional Caesar salad contains some pretty basic ingredients. Normally, it's romaine lettuce, Parmesan cheese, croutons, and Caesar dressing. This iconic dressing is made from lemon juice, egg, garlic, Parmesan cheese, Worcestershire sauce, and anchovies. Even though the tossed salad only has four ingredients, it packs a major flavor punch. </p>
    <p>However, there are some pretty tasty variations of Caesar salad, if you're looking for something different. You might find Caesar salads with chicken, steak, shrimp, or bacon for added protein. Or additional fruits and veggies, like kale, avocado, and tomatoes. </p>
